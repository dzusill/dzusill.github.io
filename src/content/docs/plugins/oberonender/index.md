**OberonEnder** replaces the vanilla ender chest with a **permission-sized** one. Every player gets 1–6 rows depending on their rank, the contents are stored in a database instead of the player file, and a chest that cannot be read is **locked, never wiped**.

It is the Oberon build of [VariableEnderChests](https://github.com/minion325/VariableEnderChests) by minion325, with safer storage, a `/oberonender reload` command, a separate `enderchest.use` permission and configurable open/close sounds.

## What it does

- 📦 **Permission-sized chests** — `enderchest.size.1` … `enderchest.size.6` give 9–54 slots. The highest node wins, `default-rows` covers everyone else.
- 🔒 **Never wipes a chest** — if stored items cannot be read, the chest is locked and never saved over. See [Safe Storage](/plugins/oberonender/features/safe-storage/).
- 🎒 **Retrieval inventory** — items above a player's current row count are not lost when their rank drops; `/retrieveender` brings them back.
- 🔊 **Configurable sounds** — separate open/close sounds for the chest block and for the command, resource-pack sounds included.
- 🚫 **World and item rules** — disable the plugin per world, blacklist materials.
- 🔄 **Converters** — import from vanilla, EnderPlus, AdvancedEnderchest and more. See [Converters](/plugins/oberonender/features/converters/).
- 🌍 **Translations** — English, Spanish, Hungarian and Simplified Chinese lang files.
- 🧵 **Folia supported.**
